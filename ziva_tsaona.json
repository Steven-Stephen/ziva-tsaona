        "description": "A tropical cyclone forecast has been issued by Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on May 28, 2023, 21:00:00 UTC. Typhoon - Mawar, currently equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson scale),  is located in the NW Pacific Ocean with maximum sustained winds of 194 km/h (121 mph), and wind gusts up to 241 km/h (150 mph).According to this forecast (#36), the cyclone is headed North-northwest at about 13 km/h (8 mph), and is expected to weaken over the next 24 hours.  It is cautioned, however, that the storm's actual position may shift significantly over the next few days. Based on the current forecast (the storm's center and path),  Typhoon - Mawar is  within 719 km (447 miles) from Japan, and the center is expected to make landfall within the next -624 hour(s), along the shores of/near Okinawa, with sustained winds of about 102 km/h (63 mph).  For the extended forecast, an estimated 15,201 people, 6,524 households, and $1.63 Billion (USD) of infrastructure* are potentially exposed to moderate to severe damaging winds (with damage expected closer to the shores).  All shorelines in the path of the storm are exposed to potential storm surge, and inland areas within the proximity of the storm are exposed to potential flooding. Additional updates will be provided as they become available by official sources.*The cost represents the total replacement value of the infrastructure."

People with lung disease (such as asthma) or heart disease, older adults, children, pregnant people, and people who work outdoors are at higher risk of experiencing health effects caused by wildfire smoke. Speak with your health care provider about developing a management plan for wildfire smoke events and maintaining a supply of necessary medications at home and always carrying these medications with you during wildfire season. Visit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values. Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. It is estimated that 424,046 people, 173,080 households, and $68.95 Billion of infrastructure* are within the affected area(s). *The cost represents the total replacement value of the infrastructure."
